        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Introvert, but loud when needed. That is a line that defines me. 
            Hi! My name is Natasha Irene <br> Nunes and I come from the beautiful country of Oman. 
            Even though I am an Indian by nationality, <br> I have spent the last 18 years of my life in Oman before moving to Canada. </br>
            <br>I am a Second year Global Business and Digital Arts student at the University of Waterloo.</br>
            I am interested in a lot of things such as music, dance, photography, art and digital marketing but <br>
            the thing I love the most is fashion. </br>
            <br>Fashion is an art form that allows you to express yourself and your views on a lot of issues. </br>
            I remember wearing different outfits, jewelry and shoes to school and not repeating my outfits more <br> than twice a month. Now that I have grown, 
            I realize how much waste it produces and in turn how <br>much harm it causes to the environment. 
            I believe fast fashion is one of the main causes of <br> environmental  degradation and hence have decided to shop sustainably from thrift stores etc. </br>
            <br> I am interested in working in the following fields; social media management, public relations, digital <br> marketing or CSR management in a fashion company. </br>
            </p>
